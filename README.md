## Description
    
With this project, users can create and host their own blog website. Users can create an account, post blogs, comment on other user blogs, and edit blog posts and comments.

In completing this project, I learned about building websites from back to front: designing databases in mySQL, setting up relationships between tables, using MVC design concepts for file structure, routing, UX/UI design, and so much more.

## Installation
    
To use the Tech Blog, clone the repository by running "git clone `git@github.com:the64man1/Tech_Blog.git`' on your console. Then use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Next you will need to create a .env file to store the information needed to connect to your local SQL database. Then create the 'tech_blogdb' in MySQL by running a query in MySQL Workbench using the schema described in the 'schema.sql' file. Then you can run the command 'npm start' to begin using the Tech Blog. Sample data is included in the seed.sql files.
    
## Usage
    
Users are free to use these files to build their own tech blog, or enjoy the functionality of the site on Heroku.
